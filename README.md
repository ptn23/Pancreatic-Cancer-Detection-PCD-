# Pancreatic-Cancer-Detection-PCD-
Being the deadliest cancer type in the world, identifying pancreatic cancer has always been a difficulty for both the medical and bioengineering fields. This project will analyze one of the ways pancreatic cancer can be detected: urine.

Libraries used: scikit-learn, HashExplainer, among others.

Due to the nature of the problem (multi-classification), RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBoostClassifier, LightGBMClassifier are used. The relevance of the traits are decided using SHAP values (install instructions inside the code file).

Work solely performed by Phuong Nguyen.
